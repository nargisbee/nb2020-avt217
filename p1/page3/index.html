    <ul>I've now just begun to love my life.
I've now begun to fear for the passing of my lifetime.
Every joy that I longed for before you was fantasy.
My heart and mind meet find it in the light of your eyes.
Oh life of my heart, oh you who is more precious than my life,
why didn't I meet your love, my <a href="../page4/index.html">darling</a>, sooner?
</ul>
