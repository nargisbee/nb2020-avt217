    <ul>You are my life whose morning began with your light
How much of my life before you has passed and gone by
My darling, how much of <a href="../page3/index.html">my</a> life has gone
My heart never experienced one bit of joy before you
And had never tasted in this world anything but the flavor of injury
</ul>
