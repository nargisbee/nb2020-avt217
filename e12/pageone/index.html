          <h2>The Coming of the Ship</h2>
          <p>

Almustafa, the chosen and the beloved, who was a dawn unto his own day, had waited twelve years in the city of Orphalese for his ship that was to return and bear him back to the isle of his birth. </p>

<p>And in the twelfth year, on the seventh day of Ielool, the month of reaping, he climbed the hill without the city walls and looked seaward; and he beheld his ship coming with the mist. </p>

<p>Then the gates of his heart were flung open, and his joy flew far over the sea. And he closed his eyes and prayed in the silences of his soul. </p>

<p>But as he descended the hill, a sadness came upon him, and he thought in his heart: </p>

<p>How shall I go in peace and without sorrow? Nay, not without a wound in the spirit shall I leave this city. 8Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret? </P>

<p>Too many fragments of the spirit have I scattered in these streets, and too many are the children of my longing that walk naked among these hills, and I cannot withdraw from them without a burden and an ache. </p>
